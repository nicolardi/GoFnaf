# GoFnaf
a recreation of five night at freddy's as a text game in GO 

## What works
cameras, battery, enemies, doors

## what i still have to fix/implement
# 1)
Golden freddy,
# 2)
someting that most of the times makes you notice that an animatronic is at your door
# 3)
a versus mode where one player controls the animatronic and the other controls the night guard

## usage
to start the game run 
go run . and to actually connect to it and play run telnet localhost 8080 on another terminal window (i'll  make an actual client in the future but for now this is good enough)
