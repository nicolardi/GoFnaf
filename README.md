# GoFnaf
a recreation of five night at freddy's as a text game in GO 

## What works
cameras, battery, enemies, doors

## what i still have to fix/implement
1)
Golden freddy, 

2)
someting that most of the times makes you notice that an animatronic is at your door

3)
a versus mode where one player controls the animatronic and the other controls the night guard

## usage
now that the game has an actual game client (if a bit rough) l'll explain how to run the server and the client

### server
to run the server you have to build it by going inside the serverside directory and running go build and then go run gofnaf to actually start the server

### client

the procedure is mostly the same, go inside the clientside directory and run go build . and then run the client executable file
